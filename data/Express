PROTIP Be sure to read Migrating from 3.x to 4.x as well as New features in 4.x.

Quick Start
The quickest way to get started with express is to utilize the executable express(1) to generate an application as shown below:

Install the executable. The executable's major version will match Express's:

$ npm install -g express-generator@4
Create the app:

$ express /tmp/foo && cd /tmp/foo
Install dependencies:

$ npm install
Start the server:

$ npm start
View the website at: http://localhost:3000

Philosophy
The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page applications, websites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs.

Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over 14 template engines via Consolidate.js, you can quickly craft your perfect framework.

Examples
To view the examples, clone the Express repo and install the dependencies:

$ git clone git://github.com/expressjs/express.git --depth 1
$ cd express
$ npm install
Then run whichever example you want:

$ node examples/content-negotiation
